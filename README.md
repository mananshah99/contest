=============
![Project Euler Rank](https://raw2.github.com/mananshah99/project-euler/master/image.png)

Solution code to problems on www.projecteuler.net. Individual problem solution code can be found in the problem files (ProblemXXX), and the shared Library used for all Java solutions can can be found at Library.java. 

A few notes:
  - Languages used include Java (primarily), C++, and Haskell (rarely)
  - Code should be used as guidance for the development of your own answers, NOT copied character-for-character in solutions; the whole point of Project Euler is to help develop one's programming skills, not to learn how to copy code. 
  - This repository is still in development; please continue to check back for more improvements and additions to code
