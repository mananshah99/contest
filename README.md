project-euler
=============

Solution code to problems on www.projecteuler.net. Individual problem solution code can be found in the problem files (ProblemXXX), and the executable file for java solutions can can be found at ProjectEuler.java. 

A few notes:
  - Languages used include Java (primarily), Haskell, and C++
  - Not all of the programs written are correct - those that have a "BROKEN" tag or are not coded at all should not be examined
  - This repository is still in development; please continue to check back for more improvements and additions to code
