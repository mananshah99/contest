project-euler
=============

Solution code to problems on www.projecteuler.net. Individual problem solution code can be found in the problem files (ProblemXXX), and the executable file for all problem solutions can can be found at ProjectEuler.java. 

A few notes:
1. Most of the programs are written in java, though some are coded in Haskell where functional one-line code was easier to write and run
2. Not all of the programs written are correct - those that have a "BROKEN" tag or are not coded at all should not be examined
3. This repository is still in development; please continue to check back for more improvements and additions to code
