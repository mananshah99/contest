     Sorted without repeats:						
        890                 Analysis:                       Sequence:

        790                 no 4's or 5's			7	7
        769                 nothing comes before 7		3	3
        762                 nothing comes after 0		1	6
        760                 nothing comes after 9		6	x
        736                                                     2	x

        731                 our sequence needs these properties:			
        729                 starts with 7			9	x
        728                 ends with 0                         0	x
        720						
        719                 process to get the solution:				
        718                 1. start with 7				
        716                 2. go through each ending and see if a sequence				
        710                 terminates unexpectedly/repeates values				
        690                 3. attain result (no repeats, ends with 0)
